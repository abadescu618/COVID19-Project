# COVID19-Project
As COVID-19 has caused so much pain and disruption world-wide in 2020, I noticed significant differences between both the way in which certain countries responded to the pandemic and in their populations' experience throughout. I wanted to better understand why this was so, and how different social and political responses could shape the lives of people in different countries. Due to their conclusiveness, I compared mortality rates across 115 countries (based on the availability of data) with factors like the level of social distancing (as measured by the reduction in outside mobility), GDP, median age, and population size. The data is sourced from Google, CIA, and WorldBank, respectively. This data could help explain why some countries experience less catastrophic impacts than others, as well as explore how effective their response has been. My goal for this project is to generate insights on where aid could best be allocated and what actions could help to better fight against the pandemic.
