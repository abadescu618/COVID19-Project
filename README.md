# COVID19-Project
As COVID-19 has caused so much pain and disruption world-wide in 2020, I noticed significant differences between both the way in which certain countries responded to the pandemic and in their populations' experience throughout. I wanted to better understand why this was so, and how different social and political responses could shape the lives of people in different countries. Due to their conclusiveness, I compared mortality rates across 115 countries (based on the availability of data) with factors like the level of social distancing (as measured by the reduction in outside mobility), GDP, median age, and population size. The data is sourced from Google, CIA, and WorldBank, respectively. Conclusions from this project can be found at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandrabadescu/ .
